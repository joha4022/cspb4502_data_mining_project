## "There is no post-hurricane world"
This data mining project aims to analyze the impact of natural disasters on the economy by location, using pre- and post-disaster datasets. The project will explore patterns and correlations between disaster frequency, severity, and their economic consequences, identifying key factors that influence recovery and resilience in different regions. By leveraging data mining techniques, the project will provide insights into the economic vulnerabilities of specific locations and inform disaster preparedness and mitigation strategies.

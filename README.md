## "There is no post-hurricane world"
Natural disasters have profound effects on both the economic and social development of nations. Research on disaster impacts, such as those caused by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, demonstrates how these disruptions can create long-term challenges in governance, human development, and economic recovery. The idea that "there is no post-hurricane world," as a 2022 exhibit at the Whitney Museum of American art put it, suggests that disasters like hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes fundamentally alter a societyâ€™s trajectory, leaving lasting scars on economic performance and social well-being. However, whether these disruptions produce temporary setbacks or long-term changes requires further exploration, particularly as it concerns social development metrics that are well-documented yet often omitted from disaster research. For example, access to clean cooking fuels, regulatory quality, access to financial institutions, etc. This project aims to fill this research gap by applying data mining and statistical techniques to a combined dataset that includes: 1. Information on natural disasters between 1960 and 2023 2. Economic and human development metrics for this time period.

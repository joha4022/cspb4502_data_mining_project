## "There is no post-hurricane world"
Our project, There is no post-hurricane world, takes its title from the 2023 Whitney Museum exhibition on Hurricane Maria’s lasting effects in Puerto Rico. It aims to analyze the economic and social impacts of natural disasters, using pre- and post-disaster datasets from 2006 to 2024. We will explore patterns between disaster frequency, severity, and economic consequences, focusing on GDP growth and metrics such as national debt, education, healthcare, and gender disparities. By comparing various disasters—including hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes—we aim to identify long-term impacts and key factors influencing recovery and resilience. Leveraging data mining techniques, this study will provide insights into the economic vulnerabilities of specific regions and inform disaster preparedness and mitigation strategies.
